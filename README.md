## About

**GitHub Graph Drawer** is a tool that helps typing text on your GitHub contributions graph, where it helps you achieve your text goal by sending you emails through out the year for each day that you're supposed to make a log of commits at, or a cheat script that draws the text directly üëÄ.

*Note: this is a fling project that will die in a while so don't get your hopes up.*
